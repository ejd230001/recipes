        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Boba tea, or bubble tea, is a popular drink that originated from Taiwan. I made this coconut variation because I had coconut cream on hand and wanted something different from the regular black milk tea variation. This coconut version tastes just like the one you'll find in a bubble tea cafe.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Bring water to a boil in a large stockpot. Pour in tapioca and simmer for 25 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from heat and let balls sit in water for 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return stockpot to the heat; simmer and stir for 25 minutes more. Remove from heat and let rest again until centers of the balls are no longer powder, another 25 minutes. Drain. </li>
            <li>Combine brown sugar and white sugar in a large bowl. Pour tapioca balls into the sugar mixture. Cover with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes while preparing the tea.</li>
            <li>Process tea, coconut cream, ice, milk, and sugar together in a blender until combined.</li>
            <li>Scoop 1/4 cup of the tapioca into each tall glass and fill with tea. Enjoy with large straws to suck up the tapioca, or use spoons.</li>
        </ol>
